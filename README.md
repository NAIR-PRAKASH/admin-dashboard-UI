# Admin Dashboard UI

**Admin Dashboard UI** is a fully responsive and interactive web dashboard built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It showcases a clean, modern design with essential admin features such as user management, analytics cards, a search filter, and data visualization.

The dashboard includes:

- **Sidebar Navigation** for easy access to different sections  
- **Interactive User Table** with live search and dynamic addition/deletion of users  
- **Add User Modal** for creating new users  
- **Dashboard Cards** to display key metrics like Users, Sales, Orders, and Revenue  
- **Monthly Sales Chart** using Chart.js  
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** for better user experience  

This project demonstrates building a complete frontend dashboard from scratch, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive layouts, and dynamic UI updates, **without using any frameworks or libraries** (except Chart.js for charts).  

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the dashboard.
